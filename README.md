ðŸ“ˆ T20 world cup cricket Data analytics-Cricket analysis [Python| Pandas| Web Scrapping| Power BI]

âœ… Key Insights -
1. Performed data analytics for T20 world cup cricket using web scraping, Python, Pandas and Power BI, I scraped ESPN cricket info with a bright data website tool and transformed it using pandas to .evaluate player performance metrics.
2. Using Power BI , I identified the top 11 players for a T20 cricket team based on various player categories and selected the best members for team which will enhance the chances to win the match.


Key Learnings -
1) This project has given me chance to work on Bright data for scrapping data for the analysis.
2) I have learned few basic differences of why using pandas over excel is important -
a) Because Excel can handle only limited around 10,000 rows after that it will start to slow down on the other hand pandas and handle millions of data easily.
b) We cam easily transform the file from json into csv in a single line code.
c) It's faster than Excel for data pipelines, automation and calculating complex equations and algorithms.
